In computer programming, Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE).
It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing
the environment. Eclipse is written mostly in Java and its primary use is for
developing Java applications, but it may also be used to develop applications in
other programming languages through the use of plugins, including: Ada, ABAP, C,
C++, COBOL, Fortran, Haskell, JavaScript, Lasso, Lua, NATURAL, Perl, PHP,
Prolog, Python, R, Ruby (including Ruby on Rails framework), Scala, Clojure,
Groovy, Scheme, and Erlang. It can also be used to develop packages for the
software Mathematica. Development environments include the Eclipse Java
development tools (JDT) for Java and Scala, Eclipse CDT for C/C++ and Eclipse
PDT for PHP, among others.

The initial codebase originated from IBM VisualAge. The Eclipse software
development kit (SDK), which includes the Java development tools, is meant for
Java developers. Users can extend its abilities by installing plug-ins written
for the Eclipse Platform, such as development toolkits for other programming
languages, and can write and contribute their own plug-in modules.

Released under the terms of the Eclipse Public License, Eclipse SDK is free and
open-source software (although it is incompatible with the GNU General Public
License). It was one of the first IDEs to run under GNU Classpath and it runs
without problems under IcedTea.
