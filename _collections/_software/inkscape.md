Inkscape is a free and open-source vector graphics editor; it can be used to
create or edit vector graphics such as illustrations, diagrams, line arts,
charts, logos and complex paintings. Inkscape's primary vector graphics format
is Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) version 1.1. While Inkscape can import and
export several formats, all editing workflow inevitably occur within the
constraints of the SVG format. Highly recommended if you are into graphic
design.
