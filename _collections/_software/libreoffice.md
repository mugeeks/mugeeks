LibreOffice is a free and open source office suite, developed by The Document
Foundation. It was forked from OpenOffice.org in 2010, which was an open-sourced
version of the earlier StarOffice. The LibreOffice suite comprises programs for
word processing, the creation and editing of spreadsheets, slideshows, diagrams
and drawings, working with databases, and composing mathematical formulae. It is
available in 110 languages. It is free to download and supports almost all
document types (excluding Apple's office suite).
