## Completed Projects

### Mark My Words

Mark My Words was the club's submission to the 2017 Open Jam game programming
competition. In the game, you design the symbols used by a civilization to
communicate.

Club members collaborated over a fun-filled weekend to produce art, music,
story, and code for the game.

### Linux From Scratch (LFS)

Starting in the Fall semester of 2016, the geeks will begin working on a simple
LFS system that will probably start out as 32bit, but may progress to 64bit
eventually given enough free time.
