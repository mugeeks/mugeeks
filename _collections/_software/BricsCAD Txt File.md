BricsCAD is a .dwg CAD software similar to AutoCAD, but much better. The first advantage of BricsCAD over the dominant CAD software AutoCAD developed by the flagship company AutoDesk is that AutoCAD costs $1700 a year for each user. AutoCAD is only available under a software as a service SaaS or subscription model, so if you decide to use AutoCAD for seven years a company and then all the sudden you decide you want to a different less expensive option, you will have to keep paying thousands of dollars to access your old files and make new ones and even view .dwg files, regardingless of the construction date.
BriccsCAD offers a one-time purhcase for $590 to $1780 for BricsCAD. This perpetual license is the cost of one year of AutoCAD.
Students can use BricsCAD Ultimate for free. BricsCAD Ultimate includes BricsCAD Lite and the Drafting workspace for making shapes in two dimensions, BricsCAD Pro which includes 3D modeling features, BricsCAD Mechanical which includes mechanical modeling functionality, and BricsCAD BIM or Building Information Modeling. 
BricsCAD has an awesome feature called the Quad cursor that uses your command history to suggest commands such as Move, Copy, Extrude, and Manipulate to anticipate what command you will use in your workflow.

There is also a free version for everyone named BricsCAD Shape.
This includes a built in library of furniture, vehicles, materials like stone brick and metal (there's even gold), and plants and landscape features.
