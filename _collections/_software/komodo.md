Komodo Edit is a free text editor for dynamic programming languages. It was
introduced in January 2007 to complement Active State's commercial Komodo IDE.
As of version 4.3, Komodo Edit is built atop the Open Komodo project. Many of
Komodo's features are derived from an embedded Python interpreter.
