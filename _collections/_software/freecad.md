FreeCAD is a free and open-source (under the LGPLv2+ license) general-purpose
parametric 3D CAD modeler. FreeCAD is aimed directly at mechanical engineering
and product design but also fits in a wider range of uses around engineering,
such as architecture or other engineering specialties. FreeCAD is currently in
a beta stage of development.
