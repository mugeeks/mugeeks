# Programming
{:.no_toc}

A programming language is a formal constructed language designed to communicate
instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be
used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express
algorithms. 

This page contains useful excerpts from the Wikipedia page for each respective
language as well as a link to the rest of the page and other resources. Official
sites also have links if the language has an official site that supports it.

## C

[Resources](http://www.cprogramming.com/)

> C, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming
> language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and
> recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By
> design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine
> instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had
> formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well
> as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to
> embedded systems. 
> 
> C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at AT&T
> Bell Labs, and used to re-implement the Unix operating system. It has since
> become one of the most widely used programming languages of all time, with C
> compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer
> architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the American
> National Standards Institute (ANSI) since 1989 (see ANSI C) and subsequently
> by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

[Resources](http://www.cprogramming.com/)

> C# (pronounced as see sharp) is a multi-paradigm programming language
> encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic,
> object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.
> It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as
> a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2006). C# is one of the
> programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure. 
>
> C# is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented
> programming language. Its development team is led by Anders Hejlsberg. The
> most recent version is C# 6.0, which was released on July 20, 2015.

## C++

[Resources](http://en.cppreference.com/w/)

> C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative,
> object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing
> facilities for low-level memory manipulation. 
>
> It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded,
> resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and
> flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in
> many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and
> resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers
> (e.g. e-commerce, web search or SQL servers), and performance-critical
> applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes). C++ is a compiled
> language, with implementations of it available on many platforms and provided
> by various organizations, including the FSF, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel and IBM.
>
> C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization
> (ISO), with the latest (and current) standard version ratified and published
> by ISO in December 2014 as ISO/IEC 14882:2014 (informally known as C++14). The
> C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC
> 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, ISO/IEC 14882:2003, standard.
> The current C++14 standard supersedes these and C++11, with new features and
> an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++
> was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979, as an extension of
> the C language as he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C,
> which also provided high-level features for program organization. 
>
> Many other programming languages have been influenced by C++, including C#,
> Java, and newer versions of C (after 1998).

## HTML

[Resources](http://www.w3schools.com/html/)

> HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the
> World Wide Web. It was finalized, and published, on 28 October 2014 by the
> World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This is the fifth revision of the HTML
> standard since the inception of the World Wide Web. The previous version, HTML
> 4, was standardized in 1997. 
>
> Its core aims are to improve the language with support for the latest
> multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently
> understood by computers and devices (web browsers, parsers, etc.). HTML5 is
> intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML. 
>
> Following its immediate predecessors HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.1, HTML5 is a
> response to the fact that the HTML and XHTML in common use on the World Wide
> Web have a mixture of features introduced by various specifications, along
> with those introduced by software products such as web browsers and those
> established by common practice. It is also an attempt to define a single
> markup language that can be written in either HTML or XHTML. It includes
> detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it
> extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and
> introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex
> web applications. For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a potential candidate
> for cross-platform mobile applications. Many features of HTML5 have been
> designed with low-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets taken in to
> consideration. In December 2011, research firm Strategy Analytics forecast
> sales of HTML5 compatible phones would top 1 billion in 2013. 
>
> In particular, HTML5 adds many new syntactic features. These include the new
> video, audio and canvas elements, as well as the integration of scalable
> vector graphics (SVG) content (replacing generic object tags) and MathML for
> mathematical formulas. These features are designed to make it easy to include
> and handle multimedia and graphical content on the web without having to
> resort to proprietary plugins and APIs. Other new page structure elements,
> such as main, section, article, header, footer, aside, nav and figure, are
> designed to enrich the semantic content of documents. New attributes have been
> introduced, some elements and attributes have been removed and some elements,
> such as a, cite and menu have been changed, redefined or standardized. The
> APIs and Document Object Model (DOM) are no longer afterthoughts, but are
> fundamental parts of the HTML5 specification. HTML5 also defines in some
> detail the required processing for invalid documents so that syntax errors
> will be treated uniformly by all conforming browsers and other user agents.

Also to be considered with HTML is CSS. 

> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the
> presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most often
> used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML
> and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain
> XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media.
> Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most
> websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web
> applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.

## Java

[Official Site](https://www.java.com/en/) |
[Resources](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-138747.html)

> Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent,
> class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few
> implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application
> developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code
> can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
> Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java
> virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2015, Java is
> one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for
> client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was
> originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since
> been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component
> of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax
> from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. 
>
> The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines,
> and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary
> licences. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java
> Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU
> General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations
> of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode
> compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin
> for applets). 
>
> The latest version is Java 8, which is the only version currently supported
> for free by Oracle, although earlier versions are supported both by Oracle
> and other companies on a commercial basis.

## JavaScript

[Official Site](https://www.javascript.com/) |
[Resources](http://www.w3schools.com/js/)

> JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming
> language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.
> Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies of World
> Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is
> supported by all modern web browsers without plug-ins. JavaScript is
> prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm
> language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming
> styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular
> expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage or
> graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it
> is embedded. 
>
> Despite some naming, syntactic, and standard library similarities, JavaScript
> and Java are otherwise unrelated and have very different semantics. The syntax
> of JavaScript is actually derived from C, while the semantics and design are
> influenced by the Self and Scheme programming languages. 
>
> JavaScript is also used in environments that are not web-based, such as PDF
> documents, site-specific browsers, and desktop widgets. Newer and faster
> JavaScript virtual machines (VMs) and platforms built upon them have also
> increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side web applications. On
> the client side, JavaScript has been traditionally implemented as an
> interpreted language, but more recent browsers perform just-in-time
> compilation. It is also used in game development, the creation of desktop and
> mobile applications, and server-side network programming with runtime
> environments such as Node.js.

## PHP

[Official Site](https://secure.php.net/) |
[Resources](http://www.w3schools.com/php/)

> PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also
> used as a general-purpose programming language. Originally created by Rasmus
> Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP
> Group. While PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, it now stands for
> the recursive backronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. 
>
> PHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in combination with
> various Web template systems and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed
> by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common
> Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server combines the results of the
> interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including
> images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a
> command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to implement standalone graphical
> applications. 
>
> The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software
> released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed
> on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of
> charge. 
>
> The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard
> until 2014, leaving the canonical PHP interpreter as a de facto standard.
> Since 2014 work has been ongoing to create a formal PHP specification.

## Python

[Official Site](https://www.python.org/) |
[Free Book](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) |
[Personal Notes](http://mugeeks.org/contents/resources/Programming/Python.PDF)

> Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its
> design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows
> programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible
> in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to
> enable clear programs on both a small and large-scale. 
>
> Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented,
> imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a
> dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and
> comprehensive standard library. 
>
> Python interpreters are available for installation on many operating systems,
> allowing Python code execution on a wide variety of systems. Using third-party
> tools, such as Py2exe or Pyinstaller, Python code can be packaged into
> stand-alone executable programs for some of the most popular operating
> systems, allowing the distribution of Python-based software for use on those
> environments without requiring the installation of a Python interpreter. 
>
> CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is free and open-source
> software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its
> alternative implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python
> Software Foundation.
