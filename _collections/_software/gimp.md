GIMP (an acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a free and open-source
raster graphics editor used for image retouching and editing, free-form drawing,
resizing, cropping, photo-montages, converting between different image formats,
and more specialized tasks. It is pretty much the open source version of
Photoshop. Even if you are not into graphic design, this is a highly recomended
program due to its extreme usefulness in all matters photo related.
